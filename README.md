## About NetworQ

NetworQ provides both the back end and a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing the user to store, manipulate and manage data much as one would if the data was held in a relational database. However, by building the relationships during the data entry stage, there is no need for complex queries to extract the information.

In concert with this flexible data-storage and retrieval is the ability to use existing packages; including the architecture and functionality they provide.

## Get Started

There are a number of options available for those interested:

* [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md)

* Read more about the [concepts](concepts.md)

## Great Packages
