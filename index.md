# NetworQ

## What is "NetworQ"?

In technical terms: NetworQ is a *multi-dimensional graph* building platform.

It is a cocktail of: Mindmaps, Business Methodologies, ERP, all wrapped up in a data-management tool.

Use it to organize your business, team, project, assests, infrastructure, life and much more...

## What can I use NetworQ for?

We've collected a set of use-cases to inspire you [here](use-cases/). Your ingenuity and imagination is all that restricts further application. Check out our [community forum](#) for more ideas.

## A 3 layer model

There are 3 layers to the data model of Networq. 

![data model](/images/SummaryDataModel.PNG) 

*Graphs* contain *Nodes*. *Nodes* get tagged with one or more *Types*.

*Types* give *Nodes* their *Properties*.

*Types* and *Nodes* can be bundled up into a *Package* to share it with others.

You can import *Packages* from others to re-use their work in your own *Graphs*.
